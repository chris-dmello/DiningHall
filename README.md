# Dining Hall
### HackUTD Project

##### This app and service is designed to improve the utd dining hall experience.

It does so by: 
(1) Allowing the users to rate their dishes, and letting the dining hall staff know what dishes are the most liked.
(2) Allowing the dining hall staff to release a poll to find out what the patrons would like to eat the next day.
(3) Accepting feedback from users regarding the dining hall, app, or anything related
(4) Having an interface for users to communicate with and find someone to dine with.
